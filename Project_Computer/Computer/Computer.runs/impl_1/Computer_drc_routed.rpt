2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net local_id/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin local_id/forward_data_reg[15]_i_1/O, cell local_id/forward_data_reg[15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u18/count[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u18/count[1]_i_2/O, cell u18/count[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT u18/count[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    u18/clk1_reg {FDCE}
    u18/clk2_reg {FDCE}
    u18/count_reg[1] {FDCE}
    u18/count_reg[0] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>
