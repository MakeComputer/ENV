PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u27/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u27/clk1_i_2/O, cell u27/clk1_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u3/MFPCOut_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u3/controllerOut_reg[20]_i_2/O, cell u3/controllerOut_reg[20]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u5/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u5/ReadData1_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell u5/ReadData1_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u5/immeOut_reg[15][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u5/immeOut_reg[15]_i_1/O, cell u5/immeOut_reg[15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u8/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u8/ALUresult_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell u8/ALUresult_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u8/PCOut_reg[15]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u8/PCOut_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell u8/PCOut_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u8/PCOut_reg[15]_2[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u8/AsrcOut_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell u8/AsrcOut_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u8/readData2Out_reg[15][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u8/WriteDataOut_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell u8/WriteDataOut_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u8/tmpCommand_reg[1]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u8/branchJudge_reg_i_2/O, cell u8/branchJudge_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#10 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u8/tmpCommand_reg[1]_3[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u8/BsrcOut_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell u8/BsrcOut_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT u27/clk1_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    u18/clk1_reg {FDCE}
    u18/count_reg[0] {FDCE}
    u18/count_reg[1] {FDCE}
