2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT u27/clk1_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    u18/clk1_reg {FDCE}
    u18/count_reg[0] {FDCE}
    u18/count_reg[1] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete
